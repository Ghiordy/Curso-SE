This is a code for a game using marbles, where was designed a mealy finite states machine to emulate a funcionality where are two inputs (A,B), 3 levers (x1,x2,x3) and 2 ouptuts (C,D):

If a marble pass once through a lever, that lever toogle its state between left or right. So, for it we've used gray decofication with all pssible states generated by levers.

| x1 | x2 | x3 | State |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | S0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | S1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | S2 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | S3 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | S4 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | S5 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | S6 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | S7 |

And states draw is presented below gives a description of transitions with its inputs and output dependency:
