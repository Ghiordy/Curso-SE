## Description

### canicasFSMmealy.py

This is a code for a game using marbles, where was designed a mealy finite states machine to emulate a funcionality where are two inputs (A,B), 3 levers (x1,x2,x3) and 2 ouptuts (C,D):

If a marble pass once through a lever, that lever toogle its state between left or right. So, for it we've used gray decofication with all pssible states generated by levers.


| x1 | x2 | x3 | State |
|----|----|----|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | S0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | S1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | S2 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | S3 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | S4 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | S5 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | S6 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | S7 |

And states draw is presented below giving a description of transitions with its inputs and output dependency:

In code, you must be find at bottom the next instruction
```
# funcion     -entradas-palancas-       -estados--------salidas-
canicasFSMmealy([2,3],[17,27,22],1,14,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[23,24])
```
This was defined for GPIO using **BCM** setup mode and should be changed in order to adapt to your purpose. The value 1 to avoid rebound in push button, as well as is used as clock and value 14 is reset pin, this must be always in HIGH other way stop executing of code.
